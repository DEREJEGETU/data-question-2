The grandfather clause of Ordinance 092-246, as amended, is interpreted as follows: A business is grandfathered if, (a)  it had a beer permit in effect on the effective date of the ordinance (May 26, 1992), or; (b)  a business did not have a beer permit in effect on the effective date of the ordinance, but had one prior to the effective date of the ordinance, and the period between the last effective date of the prior permit and the date that a new application is filed does not exceed three hundred sixty-five (365) days. The time period is calculated as follows: the first day counted is the day after the last effective date of the permit, and the last day counted is the day that the application for a new permit is filed. If, however, the prior permit was granted after January 1, 1992, and was not subject to any distance requirement, the business shall not be grandfathered.                                                                                            1\n",
